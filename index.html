        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>We are a couple Midwesterners that moved out West during the Pandemic. In that journey, we have grown
            enormously, improved ourselves, and started the process of becoming better than we were. This website and
            podcast is a way to document and share that journey and transformation. Anything is possible if you put your
            mind to it and fail enough times.
